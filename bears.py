#int -> boolean
'''
A True return value means that it is possible to win
the bear game by starting with n bears. A False return value means
that it is not possible to win the bear game by starting with n
bears.

The rules: 
If n is even, then you may give back n/2 bears.
If n is divisible by 3 or 4, then you may multiply the last two 
digits of n and give back this many bears.
If n is divisible by 5, then you may give back 42 bears.
